# Flappy-Golf-2-Autotimer2

These scripts were written in Python 2.7 using OpenCV 2.4

For the scripts to run the videos and images must be in the same directory as the 
.py file

While I was able to provide the template images I used, the videos were too big to 
put onto Git.  Here is a link to the videos:
https://drive.google.com/open?id=1HF3h0KMcSyLO0bcdaV8VxJw1L2Cw_vJz

test_big.mp4 is a 30 FPS video of an All Standard Levels Any% full game run
test_big_2.mp4 is a 60 FPS video of an All Levels Any% full game run

For now the only extensively commented script is findEndOfHole2.py
timeRun.py and timeHoles.py are WIP scripts.
